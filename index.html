**Example-Based Control via Recursive Classification**

![](images/teaser.png)

*__tldr__:
In many scenarios, the user is unable to describe the task in words or numbers, but can readily provide examples of what the world would look like if the task were solved. Motivated by this observation, we derive a control algorithm that learns a policy for solving tasks, given only examples of successful outcome states. Our method, based on recursive classification, learns a value function directly from transitions and success examples. Our method outperforms prior methods at learning from success examples. The key difference from prior work is that our method does not learn an auxiliary reward function, and therefore requires fewer hyperparameters to tune and lines of code to debug. We show that our method satisfies a new data-driven Bellman equation, where examples take the place of the typical reward function term.*

**Code**: Coming soon!

Videos of Learned Policies
===============================================================================
Below, we visualize examples of the behavoir learned by our method. The green images shown on the left are examples of the success examples our method uses to learn these tasks. Note that these success examples are not expert trajectories, but rather examples of states where the task is solved (e.g., where the nail is hammered into the wall). We emphasize that our method does not use any reward function.

**TASK:** Hammer the nail into the board.
